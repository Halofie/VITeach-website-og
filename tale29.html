                                I could honestly end former President Fiza Vahora’s VITeacher tale here with her quote above, which in my humble opinion sums up her character perfectly. But ending it here, because I’m already past the deadline would not do justice to her story. In fact, I would be robbing the world of a tale that needs to be told to inspire others with the passion for teaching, just like hers. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Fiza’s journey began with VITeach as a member of the Junior Core Committee. Unfortunately, the club, whose mission is to teach underprivileged children from school to school, was then functioning online, no thanks to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, things started to look promising after a year as Fiza finally set foot in the college and soon assumed the role of President of VITeach.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                With the kids whining back to schools as the world transitioned back to how things were, Fiza jumped into action knowing that VITeach had to resume visiting schools. The plan was to start teaching the students English while buying the club time to gather and create educational material for other subjects like Maths and Science.
                            </p>

                            <p>While she was reviving the offline classes, she was committed to not compromise the club's online impact during the pandemic lockdown. She recalls the club’s online Python sessions for the children from the slums of Mumbai and the overwhelmingly positive feedback they received. So, it was a no-brainer that the online Python sessions would continue reaching children in other parts of India who were otherwise inaccessible physically.</p>

                            <p>
                                She adds that the club’s first post-pandemic stationery drive collected stationery worth Rs.12,000 and received about Rs. 5,000 in donations, totaling approximately Rs. 17,000, all of which went towards the welfare of underprivileged students.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                However, like any journey, the club faced roadblocks, often surprisingly encountering a lack of cooperation from school management. One particular roadblock cost the club two months, despite their positive history with the school. Looking back, Fiza regrets waiting for a response as the lost time could have been dedicated to some other school which would have been more welcoming to forming a new connection with the club.
                            </p>

                                Not soon after the club was back in action, the effects of the two-year lockdown on the students became apparent. Third-grade students who should have been well versed with basic English phrases and mathematical additions, were still struggling to grasp these first-grade concepts, most likely due to having no means to attend their online classes. Once the club identified the students' needs, Fiza, along with the Office Bearers, the JCC, and numerous volunteers, poured in countless hours into creating the necessary educational materials, thereby getting the teaching back on track.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                But of course, Fiza wasn’t donning the presidential cape at all times; she was a student herself. I would quote her on the lovely way she summed up her personal life, but keeping things PG here, I would rather quote her on this - ‘I am not an akka or a didi material.’  Fiza makes it crystal clear that she wasn’t a superhuman who was juggling the club, her academics and her social life perfectly all at once. She aimed to be seen as a fellow VITeacher rather than someone above them, undermining the power hierarchy in the club. This, of course, only established herself as a true leader. A leader who had unwavering faith in her club, knowing that despite their differing ideologies, they would still have each other’s back because, at the end of the day, they shared a common goal - to help those in need. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Wrapping up the tale, she fondly remembers revisiting a school after a long gap and being greeted by children who still remembered her name; the same name they would be chanting later at the cricket field as Fiza misses each hit. She reflects on how she must have spent only ten minutes teaching the kids during her last visit. What was initially fear and uncertainty about whether she was making a difference, now began to fade away as she realized she must be doing right by these children if she was worth remembering. It was evident that what were mere ten minutes of being a VITeacher for Fiza, weren’t the same for the children.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Fiza might have missed every ball thrown at her on the cricket field, but she has never missed leaving a lasting impact on anyone she comes across, underscoring her legacy as a compassionate educator who continues to inspire others. Her tale serves as a powerful reminder of how empathy and dedication can make a lasting difference in people’s lives, more than one can ever know.
