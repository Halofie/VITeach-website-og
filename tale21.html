                              'VITeach Light a Spark, ignite a fire.' The spark and urge to ignite a fire and fill someone who deserved the life to be full of colours dates back to my very first year in college when randomly talking about Timetable discussion with a friend of mine, I was asking why she had such a free afternoon. She said, “I go to a school nearby to teach kids”.
                              <img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1k-HyOjd0yxWn1qqfTtXVeztO5RuRtPNF" style="width: 30%; float:right; margin-left:2%; margin-top:2%;"/>
                               That thing ignited the spark in me. Later on, following up, I finally joined the club and went to the School for the very first time. That day is still fresh in my mind the entire afternoon. It is one of the amazing movements in the club.Those smiles and joy expressed by the kids pretty sure can melt anyone’s heart. The notable memories have been in multiple instances, in fact, all are memorable memories. The conduction of Tamil Workshop in my first year was one such instance.I am truly grateful to the club for the trust they had in me. It was a roller coaster but it was absolute fun.The most notable memory of my experience was an event where we collaborated with Cognizant in an event conducted for Blind students. It was a long and tiring day, but helping the students for that day and the love and affection shown by them in return to the helping arm we had extended to them was just fabulous. At the end of my college memories, I was surprised by the juniors with a small and amazing farewell for us that caught me off-guard. Last but not the least the final visit to school on the occasion of Pongal 2020 Celebrations; going to school and conducting games for the kids was the best of all. All of the club meetings we had, all the projects that I helped with were such amazing experiences especially the Angilam Express project. I never ever when joining college was thinking I would be part of such an amazing family and make a change. VITeach has not only helped me by providing a platform to extend my help to change the world and make it a better place but also with providing an amazing family of juniors and seniors who made me who I am today.
                              But as life and time moves on, we too have to with it. To sum it all up, My Teach has ended but will be one of the closest to my heart.<br><br>
                              Thank You VITeach,<br>
                              Cheers VITeachers

                              “I have always been passionate about teaching others as well as sharing my wisdom and experiences. Education in one’s life plays an important role; it gives one the power of self confidence to take on the world. I have seen people dropping out of their education due to economic constraints. I have always wanted to do something to change it. When I joined VIT, I made sure to join many co-curricular activities, because I really liked to organise, serve, and participate in many events.
                              During my JEE prep days, I came to know about Avanti Fellows and Ignite, which are student bodies in IIT madras and NIT Trichy respectively. They help students in their surrounding areas to crack the JEE exams. I really liked this initiative. In this world of education as a business, very few groups are genuinely working to uplift the talented students.
                              To my surprise, Viteach also had a similar vision and so, I immediately joined the club. Even though the pandemic has slowed down our initiative, our efforts and service will always pay off. Soon enough, we will start working offline in the schools. The knowledge I have gained from the club and its mission is not limited to these four years of my college life but will stay with me for the rest of my life.
