                              People say college is a place where you make a lot of memories. For me, most of them relate to VITeach. In my second year of college, I heard there was a club that goes to a school nearby and taught kids english and it excited me to join Viteach. There is a bag full of stories and all are my favourite. I still remember the moment when I first walked into the classroom filled with kids, their dreamy eyes and their fire to achieve something. It was happiness for me, to play a small part in helping them achieve their dream. These kids are no different from us, they have the craving for knowledge, they have dreams and ambitions, the only thing that is different for them is the resources and the struggle they go through.<br><br>
                              If you ask me what I have enjoyed the most as part of VITeach, it is organizing events where kids are the guests. For the first kids carnival we hosted, I remember running around the campus and to eateries near by trying to get them to give us discounts, healthy food, a menu filled with nutritions and things kids would like to eat and at the end when it was all laid out for the kids the efforts paid off, they were happy and they had fun.<br><br>

                              The one thing I love the most that we do is "WISH TREE".

                              Wish tree was an initiative that was passed down by our seniors.

                              When we go to school, we ask the kids what they wish for and we write them down on post-its.

                              We would make a tree, put up all the post-its on it and keep it in portico with a huge carton box in front of it.
                                Anyone who was willing to help would buy anything on the list and drop it in the box. At the end of the day we had bags full of things to carry back and store. The happiest moment always is when you distribute these among the kids.<br>

                              All they wished for were small things like chocolates, a toy car, a doll, a pencil or a bag and they used to get so happy when we would give out these things. These kids taught me that happiness is not about having luxury, it is rather about the small things in life.<br><br>

                              VITeach has not only given me memories I cherish, I have also found some of the beautiful humans for life.
