On one side there was a teacher who was teaching on a blackboard underneath the shade of an old large tree on the playground while on the other side was a robotics lab sponsored by a giant tech company. The children seemed much more well-versed in STEM subjects contrary to our expectations and are continuing to be impressive. Yet they also enjoy learning English and Etiquettes taught by VITeachers.'

Children run into the school everday, enthusiastically leaving behind the worries of from the real world. The excitement on their faces as they turn back from their lessons to see a group of VITeachers lined up at their classrooms\' doorstep ready to engage them for an hour and a half can be compared to quite nothing else. VITeach conducts sessions between 1:30 PM to 3 PM for classes 1 through 8 in this school five days a week. These times become fond memories for VITeachers in the years to come. Their primary goal is to bring the communication and grammatical skills of these children upto par with the city-based private schools they studied in.
