                                I strongly believe that every human should leave a mark when he leaves a place. I come from a rural background. During my school days (1990 to 2004), in and around my native village, less than 10% of the children got a chance to study in English medium schools. I was fortunate to be a part of that 10% and I became my family’s first graduate. On the one hand, most of my schoolmates completed their engineering degree, got into the IT industry and started settling in foreign countries. On the other hand, those who didn’t get a chance to study in English medium schools found it hard to even compete for such jobs although they had a similar degree and the much needed potential. What was making the difference? It’s the ENGLISH. <br>

                                English, as a language, adds a little value to those who are good at it and creates a lot of trouble to those who are not good at it. Having realized this, I started contributing to non-English medium schools (i.e. the schools where subjects other than English are taught in Tamil). I had frequent interactions with teachers working in such schools and understood the difficulties faced by their students. I had a belief that one day I will get a better platform to serve such students. <br><br>

                                After joining VIT-Chennai (as Faculty) in June-2018, I discovered that platform. It’s VITeach. I was very much impressed when Director-Students Welfare (Dr Hemamalini) briefed the activities done by VITeach in 2017-18. Within a few days, Dr Susan Elias handed over VITeach Club to me after sensing my interest in VITeach. NO LOOKING BACK then on. <br>

                            <p>I keenly observe how youngsters spend their leisure time. They have so many options. Only those with a clear motivation to serve the society join clubs like VITeach. On almost all working days, 1 or 2 VITeach students walk to a nearby school in hot sun and render their service. I have seen them walking towards school with an intention of making a difference in the lives of many children and returning back with a sense of satisfaction. No AWARD can replace that sense of satisfaction. The love the school children show towards our VITeachers is also priceless. <br><br>

                              What more does a faculty coordinator of VITeach want when all VITeachers are GEMS?
                              It’s their planning that makes them stand out. They don’t go and teach things at random. In the beginning of every year, the syllabus team drafts the plan clearly. Every VITeacher going to school knows what he/she is teaching on a particular day and why he/she is doing so? The office bearers of VITeach establish army-like discipline within the club which makes the faculty coordinator’s job easy. I am blessed to be the faculty coordinator of VITeach.
