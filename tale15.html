                                It was in 2nd year when I started looking out for a club to get enrolled to satisfy the credit requirements. But didn't want to enroll in one just for those 2 credits. That's when I came across this social outreach club called 'VITeach' and was totally into it the moment I got to know what the club does through my friend. After that, I never had a look back at my VITeach life until I had this amazing farewell from my most amazing juniors. What happened between my FFCS enrollment and this 'amazing farewell' is just happiness that not every human would pursue in his entire lifetime. The journey with VITeach has played a great role in shaping my personality, has helped me become the person I am today. I wasn't part of the school team initially, which went to the school nearby to teach maths and English to the kids. Since I was a native Tamil speaker, I was kept as a substitute, so if someone's not able to make it on a day, I would be going to the school. And one fine day a person was not able to attend the school session and I was asked to fill that person's position. Not knowing how cathartic this experience is going to be I was actually annoyed that I had to do this duty on a scorching summer day in CHENNAI. After my first day, I started volunteering whenever the team went to schools even if they did not require any substitute. And there was this one day, which made feel so good and brightened my heart, as I wasn't allotted to any specific task, I used to hop in any class where an extra native Tamil speaker would make things easier, so one day I had to leave a bit early as I had an hour in the afternoon, and when I was leaving the class a 2nd std kid came up to me and was like, where are you going anna, I was like I have a class to attend, will see you next week, and the kid replied " Paathu poitu vaanga na'' which almost means "Take care anna !! Come back soon !" (some emotions in Tamil can't be really translated I guess) and this really touched me, that's when I felt, how much these kids love and value our presence, and make us feel that we're really doing something good.<br><br>

                            <p>And then came another amazing experience - The Thiruvannamalai - Angilam Express Project - where we used to wake up early in the morning on a Saturday and leave the campus by 5 am to reach the school when the class starts and conduct various games and activities for the kids throughout the day.
                                And the stories associated with the club goes on and on! Such an immersive experience conducting various activities and events for the club which was used for the betterment of the underprivileged kids who have the same enthusiasm to learn something like us. We were all more than happy to volunteer for events like the book fair even in our final year - which shows our love for the club and the satisfaction of contributing something.<br>
                                From a member to becoming an office-bearer - the club has given me a lot of experience, and more than anything, I'll cherish the memories created in this journey for a lifetime. These little things bring up a smile to my face whenever I think about it!! Also, I've also got amazing friends for life . You live only once, yes but if you love it right, I guess that would get by.
