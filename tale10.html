                              <br>There are 2 reasons why I joined VITeach, First one is my Passion for Teaching and Sharing Knowledge with anyone willing to learn a thing or two every day and the Second reason is there can never be a better place to do that other than for the kids who are in need of resources & study material, help them with English which is very essential in today's world and being a tiny part in helping achieve their dream. This way one of my many goals or you might say "giving back to the society" has started :) <br><br>
                                One of my memorable experiences from VITeach is we set up like a small workshop where the kids are the guests who's parents are Professors and Doctorates from our very own college and there were 2 kids named Ashwin and Bala where I was helping them with a thing about origami and painting and it might not seem big for the people who were teaching them, but both of them did a better job than any other VITeachers present there, they helped all the kids so none of them felt left out when that particular activity was over and that just showed me that whatever it is there to learn or understand from a small thing like that, they're no different from us when it comes to acquiring knowledge and they hustled everything really well that day. <br><br>
                                There's one more moment I wish to share that is at our ADW school, the moment I step into the class there's this one kid called Madhan who comes running to me and hugs and says "Anna, today let's not learn, let's play". I was surprised he actually remembered me which made me feel overjoyed and it meant a lot to me. Later that day after I had taught them everything, all of them would've aced whatever we taught them and in return, there will be around 20 kids circling me asking, "Anna one star, Anna one Ice cream" and at the end of the day, all that mattered was these small things that make them happy and satisfied which fulfills our mission. <br><br>
                                Joining VITeach was one of the best decisions in my life and it gives me the joy that I'm able to help the kids with whatever I can offer to the full extent and this has yielded me some very good memories that I'll cherish. <br><br>
